        <h1>Custom Context Menu Actions</h1>

        <p><font color="#ff0000">Please note:</font> This document still contains valid information,
        however today, since version 1.7.6, it is possible to configure custom actions in the
        <a href="../nagvis_config_format_description.html#action">main configuration</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><img src="../../general/img/nagvis-1.4-context-ssh-1.png" style="margin-right:10px;" align="left" /> 
        NagVis 1.4 introduces a powerful new feature called context menus. The 
        context menus basically are right-click menus on the status icons. You can 
        customize these menus by simply editing some template files. The template
        files are simple html files including some macros which are replaced during
        render time in NagVis.</p>
        <p>The context menus give you the ability to improve your administrative
        workflow with the monitoring information dramatically. Imagine you have a 
        NagVis map as the primary user interface to gather status information about 
        your systems and even as a base to control your systems. Imagine you can view
        status information from NagVis and simply connect to the problematic systems
        by ssh or via terminal session by just two clicks. It is also possible to store
        some default recover jobs in scripts or anything else.</p>
        <p>Take a look at this guide to get some ideas of the power of this new feature.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Quick how-to</h2>
        <p>This is a quick how-to to add a &quot;connect by ssh&quot; option to the 
        NagVis hosts context menu. Most of the changes have to be made on the client
        browsers to get it handle ssh connections. In this guide I am using the firefox
        on Ubuntu. It is no problem to get this work on other systems like Windows.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Read basics about context templates</h3>
        
        The basics about the context templates are described <a href="../context_templates.html">here</a>. Read it before proceeding.
        
        <h3>2. Create custom context template</h3>
        
        Just copy the default context template:
        
        <pre>cd /usr/local/nagvis
cp share/userfiles/templates/default.context.html share/userfiles/templates/default-ssh.context.html</pre>
        
        Now add a line to the host specific macro section like follows
        
        <pre>&lt;li>&lt;a href="ssh://[address]">[lang_connect_by_ssh]&lt;/a>&lt;/li></pre>
        
        The template is finished.
        
        <h3>3. Configure host to use the new template</h3>
        
        Set the option to use the new template called default-ssh:
        
        <pre>context_menu=true
context_template=default-ssh</pre>
        
        You can set this option in the global section of a map, in a host object or even
        a template which is used in a host object.
        
        <h3>4. Configure your client to handle ssh:// uris</h3>
        
        In this case I configure firefox (&lt; 3.5) on Ubuntu Linux. This may differ on your system.
        
        Open <code>about:config</code> in your firefox. Add some new options:
        
        <pre>Name: network.protocol-handler.app.ssh
Type: String
Value: /usr/local/bin/ssh-connect-handler</pre>
        
        <pre>Name: network.protocol-handler.expose.ssh
Type: Boolean
Value: true</pre>
        
        <pre>Name: network.protocol-handler.external.ssh
Type: Boolean
Value: true</pre>
        
        <pre>Name: network.protocol-handler.warn-external.ssh
Type: Boolean
Value: false</pre>

        <h3>4a. Firefox &gt; 3.5</h3>
        <p>If you are using Firefox 3.5 or above you only need to set the following options:</p>
        <pre>String:
network.protocol-handler.app.ssh = /usr/local/bin/ssh-connect-handler
Boolean:
network.protocol-handler.expose.ssh = false</pre>

        <h3>5. Create a handler script</h3>
        
        Create the script at the given script path. In my case it is <code>/usr/local/bin/ssh-connect-handler</code>.
        
        <pre>#!/bin/bash
xterm -e ssh ${1#ssh:\/\/*}</pre>
        
        You need to make this script executable.
        
        <pre>chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ssh-connect-handler</pre>

        <h3>5a. gnome-terminal + root-login</h3>
        <p>If you need explicit root login and like to use root login this might be a better script for you:</p>
        <pre>#!/bin/bash
#
# /usr/local/bin/ssh-connect-handler

gnome-terminal --geometry=78x10 -e "ssh root@${1#ssh:\/\/*}"</pre>
        
        <h3>6. Test handler script</h3>
        
        Just enter <code>ssh://&lt;test-host></code> in your browser address bar and press enter.
        If an xterm with the ssh session opens everything is ok here.
        
        <h3>7. Test context links</h3>
        Now open the map you configured the new context template usage. Then 
        right-click the host you configured and hit the menu entry &quot;Connect by ssh&quot;.
        A terminal window should open now.
        
        <h2>Perspective</h2>
        <p>With this knowledge you are ready to configure NagVis to be the core of your
        daily administrative and monitoring tasks. Be creative now!</p>
        <p>We like you to give us some feedback on this feature and how you use it.</p>
