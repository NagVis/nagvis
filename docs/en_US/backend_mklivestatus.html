        <h1>MKLivestatus backend</h1>
        <p>MKLivestatus is a very simple and smart Nagios eventbroker module. Livestatus
             is concepted and tuned to reduce disk, memory and cpu load caused by live-data
             processing on the Nagios system. Just as NDO, Livestatus makes use of the Nagios
             Event Broker API and loads a binary module into the Nagios process. But other
             than the NDO, Livestatus does not actively write out data e.g. to the disk.
             Instead, it opens a socket for external applications to connect to and fetches
             the current status information from Nagios. For details about the new data
             access provider take a look at the <a href="http://www.mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_livestatus.html#H1:How to access Nagios status data" target="_blank">official documentation</a>.</p>
        <p>Since the first NagVis 1.5 release the mklivestatus backend is included on
             delivery. It performs much better than all other existing backends and
             comes with less overhead than other backends. No additional database is
             needed to make this backend work.</p>

            <td><p>The socket to connect to can be a local unix socket or a tcp socket. You have to define the type at the beginning of the string. Set &quot;unix:&quot; for unix sockets or &quot;tcp:&quot; for tcp sockets.</p> <p>In case of the unix socket you need to specify the path of the livestatus unix socket to connect to.</p> <p>When using a tcp socket you have to enter a host address and a tcp port using the following scheme: &lt;host>:&lt;port>. The host address can be an IP address or an FQDN.</p></td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>timeout</td>

            <td>
                <font color="#f00">New in 1.6.4</font>: This option controls the connect timeout of the livestatus socket.
                This is just a fallback. To prevent timeouts when accessing remote sites you really should configure a statushost for the backend.
                For details take a look at the general backend parameters documented in the <a href="nagvis_config_format_description.html#backend">backend section</a>
                of the main configuration format description.</a></td>

        <p>There are also some general parameters. You can read about them in <a href="nagvis_config_format_description.html#backend">main configuration format description</a>.</p>
