        <h1>NagVis Worldmap</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The NagVis Worldmap was introduced in NagVis 1.9. It has been developed to make it possible to create
        modern and interactive geographical maps.
        <p>You can put any kind of NagVis object on a worldmap which is then rendered using
        <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">Open Street Map</a>.</p>

        <p>The most significant different to classic maps is that the single worldmaps don't have a dedicated
        set of map objects. In fact a worldmap is mainly the definition of a viewport (visible area, zoom)
        on the world. Each object you position on a worldmap is saved globally across all your worldmaps.
        This means if you add an object to a worldmap on a high zoom (detail level), the object is also added
        to worldmaps which are showing the whole earth. This has been done this way out of the assumption
        that each geographically positioned object has a single position on all maps.</p>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>There is no special software needed on the NagVis server, but there is one special requirement. To
        be able to use this feature, the browser opening NagVis worldmaps needs to be able to fetch the background
        images (map tiles) from the internet. In most corporate environments this means that your client needs
        to have a proxy server configured.</p>
        <p>The worldmaps currently use the official tile servers of Open Street Map 
        (<code>https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/</code>). This is currently hardcoded, but might be made configurable
        in the future.</p>
        
        <h2>The first call</h2>
        <p>NagVis comes with a demo worldmap called "demo-worldmap". If your NagVis is configured correctly
        and your browser is able to fetch the background images from the tile server, you should see a map
        of germany with three nodes. One node is showing the map "demo-ham-racks", which contains hosts located
        in Hamburg, one hostgroup "cgn" which contains all hosts located in Cologne and another hostgroup "muc"
        which contains all hosts located in Munich.</p>

        <p>This worldmap is defined using the map configuration file "demo-worldmap.cfg". The contents
        look like this:</p>
        
        <pre>define global {
    alias=Demo: 4 Worldmap
    parent_map=demo-overview
    backend_id=demo
    iconset=std_geo
    icon_size=32

    sources=worldmap
    worldmap_center=50.86837814203458,10.21728515625
    worldmap_zoom=6
}</pre>

        <p>Only the last three attributes are worldmap specific definitions, all of them are mandatory for
        worldmaps.</p>

        <p>The <code>sources=worldmap</code> line tells the map to use the worldmap source, which cares about
        putting all the objects having geographical coordinates, for rendering the map.</p>

        <p>The <code>worldmap_center=50.86837814203458,10.21728515625</code> specifies the latitude and longitude
        coordinates to use as initial center for the worldmaps viewport.</p>

        <p>The <code>worldmap_zoom=6</code> specifies the initial zoom level to be used when rendering the worldmap.
        NagVis allows zoom levels from 2 to 18.</p>


        <h2>Create your own worldmap</h2>

        <p>You can start creating your own worldmap by using the way you use for other maps too. Select
        <i>Options > Manage Maps</i>, then fill the <i>Create Map</i> form while choosing <i>Geographical map (interactive)</i>
        from the map type dropdown and hit <i>Create</i>.</p>
        <p>After opening the new map, you can pan and zoom to get the viewport you like, then choose <i>Edit Map > Viewport > Save View</i>
        to persist the current viewport as initial viewport in the current worldmap.</p>

        <p>You can also create a new worldmap from an existing one by zoom and pan to create the viewport you like
        to use for your new worldmap, then choose <i>Edit Map > Viewport > Save as new Map</i>.
