	<h2>What is NagVis?</h2>
		<p>NagVis is a visualization addon for the well known network management system Nagios&reg;.</p>
		<p>NagVis can be used to visualize Nagios data, e.g. to display IT processes like a mail system or a network infrastructure.
			Using data supplied by NDO (a Nagios addon) it will update objects placed on maps in certain intervals to reflect the current status.
			These maps allow to arrange the objects to display them in different layouts:
			<ul>
				<li>physical (e.g. all hosts in a rack/room/department)</li>
				<li>logical (e.g. all application servers)</li>
				<li>geographical (e.g. all hosts in a country)</li>
				<li>business processes (e.g. all hosts/services involved in a process)</li>
			</ul>

	<h2>How does NagVis work?</h2>
		<p>In general NagVis is a presentation tool for the information which is gathered by Nagios. NagVis collects the information from backends. 
		There is a default backend delivered with NagVis: NDO MySQL Backend. This backend reads all information from the NDO (Nagios Data Out) MySQL database. 
		The NDO is an addon for Nagios. You can find it on the <a href="http://www.nagios.org/" target="_blank">official Nagios Homepage</a>.</p>
		<p>You can add all objects from Nagios (Host, Services, Hostgroups, Servicegroups) on so called maps. Each map can be configured through its own
		<a href="map_config_format_description.html">configuration file</a>. You can edit the configuration files directly by using your favorite text editor 
		or the web configuration tool called WUI. Furthermore you can add some special NagVis objects to the maps. These objects are shapes, textboxes and 
		reference objects for other maps.</p>
		<p>Each of the objects on your maps can be configured to fit your needs. For example there are links to the Nagios frontend on each object which represents
		a Nagios object. You can easily customize these links.<br>
		There is a hover menu which is enabled by default. The hover menu displays detailed information
		for each object. Hover menus can easily be modified by changing the <a href="hover_templates.html">templates</a> for them. You can also disable the hover menu.<br> 
		By default the objects are displayed as icons on the map. You can change these icons by adding <a href="extending/iconsets.html">iconsets</a> from the NagVis 
		homepage or create your own. The objects can also be displayed as lines or as <a href="gadgets.html">gadgets</a>.</p>
		<p>In addition to the normal maps there is an <a href="automap.html">automap</a>. The automap is generated automatically based on the Nagios configuration. For using the automap 
		you have to set up the parent relationships in Nagios. The automap generates a background image based on the configuration, the layout parameters and the parent 
		relationships.</p>
