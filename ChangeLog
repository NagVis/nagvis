    for viewing maps in the context of this user
  * FIX: Fixed state weight definition parsing
  * FIX: Fixed demo automap (missing programStart method in demo backend)

         lines of type -->BW+%-><-BW+%--

1.7.8

  * FIX: Fixed hiding of shapes during refresh (enable_refresh=1)
  * Reverted change from 1.7.5 (Weathermap lines with byte/bit values in 
    labels should print human) which broke the handling for some plugins

1.7.7
Core:
  * Implemented "on demand" maps. Maps which only need a basic configuration
    of global parameters like automaps and geomaps can now be configured and 
    created on demand by URL parameters. This mode is reached by simply
    calling the map URL without "show=" parameter and a bunch of parameters
    for the global section of the map instead.
  * Implemented center and bottom as label coordinate values which are
    automatically calculated depending on the rendered sizes

Automap:
  * Changed default behaviour of the automap concerning the root host. By
    default NagVis uses a virtual root node which represents the monitoring
    core. It adds the parent tree and all nodes which have no parents defined
    below this node. If no parents are configured, all hosts are rendered
    below this virtual root node.

1.7.6
Core:
  * Improved main configuration parsing code (should not mixup comments
    and empty lines anymore)

    as UNKNOWN (orange) in the multisite snapin

Geomap:
  * New option source_type to configure a csv file or the used backend as
    datasource. In backend mode, the backend used on the map must support
    the new geomap functions (currently only livestatus backend). All hosts
    to be shown need the custom variables _LAT and _LONG. The hosts can
    optionally be filtered by hostgroups

  * Cleaned up session auth code (Moved session module code to auth handler)
  * Bugfix: The installer overwrites the default iconset files on upgrade as expected
  * Added mechanism to search userfiles in independent structures. This allows
    usage of the local/ structure in OMD
  * Bugfix: Fixed section merging in main config when using more than one config file
  * Using configured permissions on uploaded files (backgrounds, shapes, maps) now
  * Gadgets: Added gadget_type option which can now be img/html. The value

  html mode assumes that the gadget does not render images as classic gadgets
  but renders HTML code
  * Changed redirect scripts index.php/config.php to ignore hosts/ports/proto
    just care about the paths - should be more robust

  * Automap params changed via GUI can be made permanent now
  * The x/y coords don't need to be set as dummy values in automap configs anymore

  * Bugfix: PHP error when trying to write to socket while the remote host is not
    available

Frontend
  * Completely removed the WUI and merged the functionality into the regular frontend.
    You can now "lock/unlock" all objects for editing using the "Edit Map" menu.
  * Added new sidebar for better navigation. It can be opened by clicking on
    the "Open" label in the header menu. The state of the sidebar and the
    single nodes is stored in user specific profile files
  * Added new parameter {parent_map} to map/automap global sections which is
    used in header/sidebar menus to draw a map hierarchy
  * Colors and ranges of weathermap lines are now customizable using the
    object configuration option line_weather_colors
  * Fixed wrong label for MBit/s in weathermap bandwidth display
  * It is now possible to lock/unlock objects in regular frontend (with the
    necessary permissions)
  * Lines can now be repositioned by dragging the ends using the anchors in unlocked mode
    in regular frontend

  * Several code cleanups; Reduced duplicate code
  * Made background color in frontend configurable now
