         (If you want to solve this issue for your installation without updating NagVis,
	  you can remove the file std_table.php from your installation. It is
	  only needed if you use the std_table.php gadget.)

1.9b12
Frontend:
  * FIX: Fixed possible empty maps when manually disabling the header menu
  * FIX: Fixed refresh of changed map properties (like background image)

    objects that are not aggregations.
  * NDO MySQL backend: Filtering out legacy objects from DB (setting is_active filter)
  * FIX: Updated php-gettext to 1.0.12 and commented out unused code because it contains
    some exploitable PHP code which could be used to inject code using modified .mo files.
    However, NagVis has never used these functions, so was never affected by this issue.

Frontend:
  * FIX: Fixed error in ad-hoc automaps (Network Topology in Check_MK) during state updates

  * FIX: Fixed wrong scaling of object labels in IE

Core:
  * FIX: Negative lat/long coordinates can now be configured
  * Changed handling of deprecated map object attributes: They are silently
    ignored by NagVis now. We inform users about deprecated (useless)
    attributes in the ChangeLog and will mark old options in the documentation,
    but the map loading will not be affected by the deprecated options anymore
  * BI-Backend: Is now handling the acknowledgement and downtime infos of BI
  * FIX: Fixed possible broken global section during editing of maps when an
    object on the map got an object ID starting with "0e."
  * FIX: Added proper error message when trying to use dynamic groups with NDO
         MySQL backend (which does not support dynamic groups)
  * FIX: Only reading map configuration files with lower ".cfg" suffix. Maps
         having e.g. an upper case ".CFG" suffix caused problems in NagVis and
	 will not be read anymore. Please rename your map config files to match
	 the ".cfg" suffix.

Automap:
  * FIX: Fixed exception when filtering maps by non existant host groups. Now
         the map is just left empty instead of raising an exception.

1.9b1
Core:
  * Added option only_permitted_objects to restrict the objects a user can see
    to the objects which a user is a contact for. This feature is currently
    used only with the livestatus backend. It's disabled by default to keep
    the default behaviour of NagVis. Thanks to norbert for providing the patch!
  * Stale object states have the same state weight as when they are not stale
    now. In previous versions the stale states were treated as being "less"
    worse, but this seem to be logically wrong to me. If you want the old
    behaviour back, you might change the state weights in your main
    config.
  * Deprecated unused config option header_fade / headerfade
  * Removed unusued config option line_arrow from all objects
  * Removed unused config option controls_size from main configuration

Worldmap:
  * Introduced new interactive worldmaps. You can use these maps to position
    all kind of NagVis objects on a geographical maps where you can browse
    interactively in (zooming, panning, ...)

Automap:
  * Reimplemented missing "filter_by_state" functionality

Frontend:
  * Showing header menu on full page error messages to give the users the
    option to navigate away from the error situation
  * Header menu dropdown menus now open on click instead of hover which is
    hopefully more user friendly as it is more unlikely to open/close the
    menu unintended
  * The sidebar is now toggled using a small control below the NagVis logo
  * Reworked frontend dialogs to show form error messages directly in the dialog
    instead of showing the old error popup window
  * The map / object editing dialog is now using a tab navigation to reduce
    the number of options shown at once for a more user friendly handling
  * It's now possible to use the macro [obj_display_name] in child objects
   in hover menus of hosts or any other objects having childs (Thanks to
   Andreas Steinel)
  * Dropped jsGraphics line rendering (browser needs to support canvas now)
    for being able to use lines within NagVis
  * Maps are not reloaded anymore when adding/editing objects. Only the
    affected objects on the map are reloaded
  * Overview: Broken map configs do not prevent to open the map anymore
  * Lines: Are now rendered nicely on high resolution devices (e.g. 4k screens)
  * Lines: Re-implemented borders round the lines for better visibility
  * Lines: Removed line action areas (small dotted boxes). The line related
    actions (hover, context, link) are now possible on the whole lines
  * Removed need to confirm object deletion (you already need at least two clicks:
    open the context menu, maybe unlock, and then click on delete)
  * Adding/modifying map objects does not trigger map reload anymore. This makes
    editing maps much more fun since you can do your work much faster! :-)
  * Labels: When center/Bottom positioned labels are dragged, the resulting
    coordinates will still be relative ones to the object coordinates
  * Labels: When dragging relative positioned labels, the object is highlighted
  * Showing hint about absolute/relative coords while dragging objects
  * FIX: Stateless lines now handle line_color and line_color_border correctly
  * FIX: Removed useless weathermap line type selections from stateless lines
  * FIX: Fixed annoying browser warning message when reloading pages which
    are shown up right after logging in to NagVis

  * FIX: Fixed js error when moving an object out of the screen

1.8.6
Core:
  * FIX: Template objects can now be used recursive
  * FIX: Fixed missing Url/view/* permission. It was not possible to permit
  non admin users to access external URLs in rotation pools without this
  permissions.

1.8.5
Core:
  * FIX: Livestatus Backend: Fixed exception handling when fetching services
    which are marked to be in a downtime, but the downtime defails can not
    be fetched
  * FIX: Fixed missing Action/perform/* permission for auth databases created
    with NagVis versions newer than NagVis 1.7b3. All auth databases which
    have been created before, have the Action/perform/* permission available.
    It was not possible to permit user not having the */*/* permission to the
    acknowledgement and custom actions via the context menu

Frontend:
  * Multisite Snapin: Improved performance when a lot of users use the snapin.
    The snapin contents were calculated on each access in the past. Now, the
    snapin contents are cached for 15 seconds. This gives a good performance
    boost when multiple users have use the snapin while having access to the
    same set of maps.

1.8.4
Core:
  * FIX: BI Backend: Fixed wrong summary state of aggregation objects when
    not using the worst aggregation function. NagVis is now using the summary
    state provided by the backend

  * FIX: The pseudo map root node can be made root again by context menu
  * FIX: Fixed setting too many view options when changing the root node

Frontend:
  * FIX: Forcing IE to always use the last available engine
  * FIX: Fixed dynmap_object_types exception after creating a dynmap

  * FIX: Maps with source related problems (like geomaps without location file)
    can now be deleted again using the map management dialog
  * FIX: Don't raise whole page errors when fetching of container URLs failed
    instead the javascript error message is shown in the container
  * FIX: Fixed too many context actions showing up for non host objects
  * FIX: Hiding eventual open color pickers on closing frontend windows
  * FIX: It's possible to put javascript code in labels or textboxes again

1.8.2

Frontend:
  * FIX: Map import: Added missing validation of map name format
  * FIX: Hiding "loading..." animation when maps are disabled on overview page
  * FIX: Fixed sorting of maps on overview page
  * FIX: Fixed js exception "g_map_names" not defined when having
         header_show_states set to disabled
  * FIX: Fixed overlapping sub-hover menus for adding icons/lines

1.8.1
Core:
  * It is now possible to configure external URLs within rotations in two types:
    a) embed it directly on the page: [http://url...]
       This is useful when including only snippets of HTML without own styles,
       scripts etc.
    b) show the URL within an iframe: [iframe:http://...]
       This is useful when including a whole webpage with own styles and scripts

Frontend:
  * FIX: Fixed form processing (e.g. user- and role management, pw change dialogs)
  * FIX: Cached ajax queries last no longer than 30 seconds now

1.8
Core:
  * All stateful objects can now be rendered as gadgets
    (Although there is no gadget available yet which is useful for objects
    which have no perfdata. But you can build one now)
  * The option gadget_type is now deprecated as the type is automatically detected
  * Gadgets can use object member states now
    Gadgets are now called with mixed POST request where the GET vars used in previous
    versions are still handed over to the gadgets per GET parameters to
    maintain compatibility. More complex parameters are now given to the
    gadget with POST vars. For example there is the POST var "members" now,
    which provides information about the object members states.
  (e.g. to be able to parse units like Kb/s, even when they are not allowed
  according to nagios plugin guidelines)
  * FIX: gadgets_core.php perfdata parsing allows "/" for perfdatas UOM now

Frontend:
  * Huge update of GUI design for a more consistent look n feel
  * Overview page uses whole page width (floating layout) for maps
  * Deprecated "cellsperrow" configuration option in [index] section
  * URLs of shape images can now be configured via configuration dialog
  * Added std_table.php gadget which can render state tables for any stateful object type
    (Thanks to Thibault Cohen for providing the idea and base code!)
  * Usability fix: Header dropdowns now only close when clicking somewhere out
    of the menu instead of hiding when moving the mouse out of the menu
  * Reworked map management dialog for more comfortable form handling (errors, validation etc.)
  * Map sources can now only be selected during map creation via GUI. When you like to
    change map sources for an existing map, you will need to to it by modifying the
    map configuration files directly. But this should be a very rare situation
  * FIX: Fixed exception when trying to define Multiple/Other values for "sources"
  * FIX: Fixed relative label positioning (center, bottom) on first page load sometimes wrong

1.8rc3
Core:
  * New backend: Check_MK Business Intelligence (mkbi) which can be used to
    add Check_MK BI aggregations to your maps
      (Configure this new backend, then add "Aggregation" objects to your maps)
  * FIX: Livestatus: Fixed wrong state aggregation for dynamic service groups

Frontend:
  * FIX: Changed sorting of maps in sidebare/header to ignore case of names (natural sorting)
  * FIX: Fixed exception preventing editing the map options of geomaps

  * FIX: The line_arrow is now configured using a dropdown field

Core:
  * Multisite Authorisation: It is now possible to specific manage map view/edit permissions
  * Livestatus: Added missing space OutputFormat livestatus header (worked before, but was
    implementing the livestatus protocol strictly not strict
  * Livestatus: Using "name" column instead of "host_name" when querying the hosts table now
    (Also worked as implemented before, but was using non documented livestatus behaviour)

Automap:
  * Now using line_color and line_width for connectors from map global definitions
  * Now using label_(show|border|background|maxlen) definitions from map globals
  * FIX: Removed useless "Make root" link for connector lines
  * FIX: Removed map editing options from menus which make no sense
  * FIX: Removed line_type option from map global definitions

Geomap:
  * FIX: Removed map editing options from menus which make no sense
  * FIX: Removed not working geomap types osmarender and cycle
  * FIX: Removed global map parameter map_image. Technically it could be changed,
         but seems a bit senseless for geomaps
         (where the background is rendered automatically)
  * FIX: Tried to fix geomap_zoom parameter, but does still not work with all zoom levels

1.8b6
Geomap:
  * Geomaps support multiple backends as object source now

1.8b5
Frontend:
  * Multisite snapin: Parent maps in tree mode can now be clicked to open the map
  * Add support for secure and httponly cookies (sesscookiehttponly,  sesscookiesecure)
    (Thanks to mikael.falkvidd@op5.com for the patch)
  * FIX: Fixed links of rotation steps (always linking to last step)
  * FIX: Hiding empty "Action" header menu entry on overview page
  * FIX: Trying to fix too long map list in dropdown menu (menu is scrollable now)
  * FIX: Fixed small styling issues in header menu

Core:
  * Dealing with the staleness value of hosts and services as a new sub-state
  (like downtime / ack); The staleness marks the state of a host/service as outdated
  * FIX: Deleting no longer required map permission entries (e.g. of maps deleted
  by hand) before rendering the manage roles dialog
  * FIX: Updating map permissions during renaming of maps (not renaming via CLI)

1.8b4
Frontend:
  * Multisite snapin now transports downtime / acknowledgement information
  * FIX: Custom context actions: Conditions, e.g. filtering by custom vars, did not work
  * FIX: Fixed zoom of text in textbox objects in chrome
  * FIX: Not altering relative object coordinates when zoom_scale_objects is
  disabled
  * FIX: Disabling save button during adding new objects to prevent double adding
  * FIX: Roles can not be deleted when used by users
  * FIX: Last assigned role can now be removed from a user

Automap:
  * FIX: Removed debug code which might prevent map rendering in some cases

1.8b3
Frontend:
  * Added option "zoom_scale_objects" to default section of global config to
    allow users to control the scaling behaviour of zoomed objects. By
    default the whole maps is zoomed like in previous versions. But when
    zoom_scale_objects is set to 0, the map objects and labels are not
    resized, but only repositioned according to the given zoom factor.

         currently not enabled by default. Use "a2enconf nagvis" to enable it.

1.8b1
Core:
  * Changed internal structures to improve memory consumtion on large maps
  * Added authorisation module based on the users contact group memberships
    defined in the monitoring core
  * It is now possible to merge states of host, hostgroup and servicegroup
    objects with equal names from different backends. For example, this can
    be used to create a single hostgroup object on a map which is populated
    by different hostgroups from several monitoring instances. This is simply
    configured by putting several backend ids to the backend_id parameter
    (separated by ",").
  * Added new object called "dynamic groups". Can only be used with livestatus
    backend. It uses the configuration option object_filter to group a dynamic
    list of services or hosts in a NagVis map object without having to define
    it in the monitoring core.
  * Added new map source "dynmap" which can be used to realize some sort of
    dynamic maps. Those maps list several objects matching a given livestatus
    filter on the map. In first instance it automatically gathers the list of
    objects to add on this map and positions them in a grid on the map. The
    user can then modify all the objects, for example change their options
    like, positions and visualisation.
  * Changed default http_timeout from 10 to 2 seconds
  * Added new iconset std_area, which can be used to create maps which are
    visible from a greater distance

  * Added "on-demand-filter" header menu to support quick filter mechanism
    for on demand automaps
  * Host labels are now limited to 14 chars on automaps
  * Again, trying to improve the default automap rendering

Frontend:
  * All nodes with assigned childs in sidebar are now expandable. The state
    is stored for each user individually.
  * Changed map rendering on overview from a single bulk request to one
    request per map.
  * Added optional zoom bar and mousewheel zoom handlers (ALT + wheel move)
    (Must be enabled with option "zoombar=1")
  * Added new option multisite_snapin_layout to render the multisite snapin
    in a "tree" instead of a "list"
  * Summary states of maps can now be displayed in the sidebar menu (must be
    enabled by setting header_show_states=1 in [defaults] section in global
    configuration)
  * The "zoom" parameter can be configured to "fill" to make the view fill the
    whole viewport of the browser
  * FIX: Fixed centering of overview tables when opening the sidebar
  * FIX: Fixed mouse pointer confusions when adding a new object and hovering
    another menu which then shows up the hover menu
  * FIX: Ajax request: Not setting headers which are usually set by the browser
  * FIX: Fixed displaying default value in object / global attribute edit dialog

         lines of type -->BW+%-><-BW+%--

1.7.8

  * Reverted change from 1.7.5 (Weathermap lines with byte/bit values in
    labels should print human) which broke the handling for some plugins

1.7.7
Core:
  * Implemented "on demand" maps. Maps which only need a basic configuration
    of global parameters like automaps and geomaps can now be configured and
    created on demand by URL parameters. This mode is reached by simply
    calling the map URL without "show=" parameter and a bunch of parameters
    for the global section of the map instead.
  * Implemented center and bottom as label coordinate values which are
    automatically calculated depending on the rendered sizes

Automap:
  * Changed default behaviour of the automap concerning the root host. By
    default NagVis uses a virtual root node which represents the monitoring
    core. It adds the parent tree and all nodes which have no parents defined
    below this node. If no parents are configured, all hosts are rendered
    below this virtual root node.

1.7.6
Core:
  * Improved main configuration parsing code (should not mixup comments
    and empty lines anymore)
  * Added shinken business_impact filter to automaps (set shinken_features=1
    in [global] section in main configuration to enable this feature)
    Thanks to Thibault Cohen for the patch)

    as UNKNOWN (orange) in the multisite snapin

Geomap:
  * New option source_type to configure a csv file or the used backend as
    datasource. In backend mode, the backend used on the map must support
    the new geomap functions (currently only livestatus backend). All hosts
    to be shown need the custom variables _LAT and _LONG. The hosts can
    optionally be filtered by hostgroups
  * Bugfix: Always rounding calculated coordinates, fixed negative coords
